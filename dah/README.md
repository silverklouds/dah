ColoredService

ColorShapeServiceImpl 
takes a selection of a Shape and a Color and return a result object along with the inputs.
With no conditional statements or data structure, I chose to store the input-output mapping in the classes.
The service converts the Color and Shape input into an instance that has the defined result.
This allows the output to either be mapped back to Color and Shape, or a completely 
different instance, which is currently implemented.

ColoredShapeTest
simple tests that cover the three input-output definition.
